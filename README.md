This is a little [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
Here are the stacks I've used for this project:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that is a web framework based on React
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Run locally

First, install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## More details

We've implemented 2 kinds of forms:

- one with tooltips that gets fired 1 second after a user hovers over a field
- another with side field descriptions, which becomes bold during the field focus event
